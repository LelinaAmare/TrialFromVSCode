                                <p>It's easy to get started with our online application. You can complete your application now or return later to finish. We'll save your information so you can pick up right where you left off.

                                    <br><br>When you apply, it helps to have the following information handy:
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>A copy of your transcript(s) listing dates of attendance as well as degree(s) and credits earned</li>
                                      <li> For military students and veterans, documents showing your date of separation and status </li>
                                    </ul></p>

                                      After submitting your application, you'll be given access to your online student account, where you can check your application status, pay your application fee, and more. We will review your application within two business days and notify you if any additional documents are required.
