            The culture of Ethiopia is diverse and generally
             structured along ethnolinguistic lines.
              The country's <i><b><small>Afro-Asiatic-speaking</small></b></i> majority 
              adhere to an amalgamation of traditions that were
               developed independently and through interaction
                with neighbouring and far away civilizations,
                 including other parts of <i><b><small>Northeast Africa, 
                 the Arabian Peninsula, India, Italy and Malaysia.</b></small></i>
                  By contrast, the nation's Nilotic communities and
                   other ethnolinguistic minorities tend to practice 
                   customs more closely linked with South Sudan and/or
             the African Great Lakes region.<br><br>

                        traditional secular music is played by
                         itinerant musicians called <i><b><small>azmari (Zageth)</b></small></i>,
                          who are regarded with both suspicion

                <b>Music</b><br><br>
                The music of Ethiopia is extremely diverse,
                 with each of the country's ethnic groups being 
                 associated with unique sounds. Some forms of 
                 traditional music are strongly influenced by folk
                  music from elsewhere in the Horn of Africa,
                   especially Somalia. However,
                   <i><b><small>Ethiopian religious music also has an ancient Christian element, traced to Yared,
                     who lived during the reign of Gabra Masqal.</b></small></i>
                      In northeastern Ethiopia, in Wollo, a Muslim 
                      musical form called manzuma developed in 1907.

               <b>Clothing</b>
               <br><br>
            In some central and northern areas,
             women's traditional clothes are often made
              from cloth called <i><b><small>shemma</b></small></i>. 
            It is basically cotton cloth,
             about 90 cm wide, woven in long strips which 
             are then sewn together.
              
             These traditional clothes are still worn on a day-to-day-basis in the countryside. 
             In cities and towns, western clothes are popular. However, on special occasions 
             such as <i><b><small>New Year (Enkutatash), Christmas (Genna) or weddings,</b></small></i> some wear traditional clothes.

                            Yet another unique feature of Ethiopian culture is its childlike 
                            style of painting that is found in every church and other important
                            locations. This style seems to have remained almost unchanged for 
                            centuries.

                            Figures are drawn in two dimensions, <i><b><small>almost cartoon-like in

                While Addis Ababa is much like any other African capital city with regards to its cars,
                taxis, lorries and general bustle, elsewhere in Ethiopia private transport is rare.
                The roads, largely unpaved, are mainly used by
                <i><b><small>people on foot, many individuals walking miles per
                day</b></small></i> to reach the nearby town or village. Carrying

                    Ethiopia is as individual in its food and drink as
                     it is in so many other aspects of daily life.
                      Even though the menu choice is not particularly wide, 
                    the Ethiopian people delight in sharing what they have
                     with habesha and farengi alike.<br>

                    While the outside world may think famine is a
                     permanent concern in Ethiopia, the majority of the 
                     country are able to secure their daily sustenance, 
                     either through growing their own food or exchanging goods at market.

                            Many people say that coffee served in an Ethiopian home is the best they have experienced.
                            <i><b><small>Shai (tea)</b></small></i> is also popular in Ethiopia, and is usually served in small glasses with no milk and plenty of sugar.
